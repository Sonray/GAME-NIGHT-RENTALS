            <h4>FIFA 20 Review: The good, the bad and the bottom-line</h4>
            <p>The nearly undisputed King of the Virtual Pitch is back with its latest release. Fifa 20 will be
                available worldwide on September 24 but I've had my hands on a review code form EA about a week ago. As
                is the case with almost every sports game these days, the entire scope of the release requires more than a couple
                 days to completely evaluate. After taking shots, wins, losses and lessons in the <span>Volta</span> mode career
                  career, kickoff and FUT, I've finally settled on my good, bad and bottom-line for FIFA 20. <br>

            <h4>CALL OF DUTY: Modern Warfare 'The best call of duty in the decade' </h4>
            <p><span>Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare</span> is half prequel, half reboot to the modern warfare franchise. The game takes place before
                the events of <span>Call Of Duty 4:Modern Warfare</span> but since this is re-imagining of the entire story, developer infinity Ward still has plenty of
                room to not simply revisit the events of those earlier games, but alter and expand upon them however they seem fit. It is also a return to more grounded, realistic military shooter 
                of futuristic entries . Gone are advanced mobility mechanics-double-jumping and wall-running and good riddance.<br>
